#  GN-SKETCH
This simple project involves using JavaScript to create something similar to the Etch-a-sketch.
The user enters the exact dimensions of their desired sketchpad, after which the sketchpad is created.
After creation, the user can make simple to complex sketches by simply moving the cursor over different points on the
sketchpad.
The drawing color available is black.

### Languages Practiced using GN-Sketch:
+ HTML.
Here we use very little HTML, basically to create the div containing the sketchpad and to create the buttons.
+ CSS.
We have employed normal CSS and very minimal Bootstrap to style our sketchpad.
+ JavaScript.
This is where most of the code is. We have used JavaScript to create the square divs that will be used to create the sketchpad. We have also used it to prompt the user to enter the specific dimensions of the sketchpad they desire. Lastly, we have also used it to allow the color of the divs to change on mouse over, hence creating our sketches and drawings.

**Have a look at the code and if you can, suggest any changes or improvements that can be made to the simple game.**
